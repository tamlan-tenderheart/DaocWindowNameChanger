# Dark Age of Camelot Window Title Changer
A small, simple, and stupid script to change the title of a DAOC game window to identify the account

To use this script, you must have AHK (https://www.autohotkey.com/) installed.

## Usage:
Click a DAOC Game Window (make it the active window), then Press F1-F4 to set the title to the appropriate account name

## Notes
I use 4 accounts on the server I am currently playing (Celestius RvR), which is why I have them assigned to F1-F4.
If you run more or less accounts, you can either trim or copy-paste additional hotkey sections to the script as appropriate.

You must edit the script before running it and replace the names for Accounts 1-4 on lines 20-23 to the names of your own accounts
